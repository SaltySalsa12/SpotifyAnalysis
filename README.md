SQL Data Analysis Queries üîçüìà
The following SQL queries power the analytics engine for Spotify listening history analysis. Executed in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), these T-SQL scripts extract key insights from streaming history data.

Basic Analytics
Summary Metrics

SELECT COUNT(*) as total_plays                    -- Total tracks played
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT [Track Name])               -- Unique songs
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Artist)                     -- Unique artists
Calculates foundational metrics for dashboard overview cards.

Top Content Analysis

-- Top 10 tracks by total listening time
SELECT TOP 10 [Track Name], Artist, ... 
ORDER BY total_seconds_played DESC

-- Most-played artists with hours listened
SELECT Artist, COUNT(*) AS Total_Plays, ... 
ORDER BY Total_Hours_Played DESC
Powers the "Top Tracks" and "Artist Rankings" visualizations.

Intermediate Analysis
Temporal Patterns

-- Hourly listening heatmap (grouped into Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night)
WITH listening_patterns AS (...)

-- Day-of-week analysis with average track duration
SELECT DATENAME(WEEKDAY, Timestamp) as Day_Of_Week...
Feeds the hourly heatmap and weekly trends charts.

Skip Behavior

SELECT [Track Name], Artist, 
       ROUND(...) AS Skip_Percentage
HAVING COUNT(*)>=5
Identifies tracks with >5 plays and their skip rates for ML training data.

Advanced Analysis
Session Detection

WITH session_breaks AS (...)
SELECT session_id, session_start, session_end...
Uses 30-minute gaps between plays to define listening sessions.

Artist Discovery Timeline

WITH first_listen AS (...)
SELECT day_of_week + ', ' + CAST(day AS VARCHAR)...
Tracks when new artists were first played (formatted as "Tuesday, 3rd April 2024").

Key Technical Notes
Duration Conversion: Uses CHARINDEX and SUBSTRING to convert MM:SS durations to seconds

CAST(SUBSTRING([Duration...])*60 + CAST(SUBSTRING(...))
Temporal Functions: Leverages DATEPART() and DATENAME() for time-based aggregations.

Data Filtering: Excludes null values for [Track Name] and Artist in critical queries.

These queries directly feed into the dashboard's Chart.js visualizations and ML models through Flask API endpoints. See the SpotifyQueries.sql file for full implementation details.
